# AnimeVerse - Interactive Portfolio Project

A fully responsive website showcasing advanced frontend development skills with immersive 3D animations, interactive UI/UX elements, and modern web technologies.

**Live Demo**: [https://anime-verse-lovat.vercel.app/](https://anime-verse-lovat.vercel.app/)

##  Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Frontend Development
- **Advanced JavaScript ES6+** - Complex DOM manipulation, event handling, and animation logic
- **Three.js Integration** - 3D scene creation, geometry manipulation, and WebGL rendering
- **GSAP Animations** - Professional-grade timeline animations and scroll-triggered effects
- **Canvas API** - Custom particle systems and dynamic background effects
- **Intersection Observer API** - Scroll-based animations and lazy loading

### Interactive Features
- **3D Visualizations** - Floating geometric shapes with real-time lighting and materials
- **Particle Systems** - Dynamic background particles with physics-based movement
- **Character Animations** - Interactive cartoon characters with facial expressions
